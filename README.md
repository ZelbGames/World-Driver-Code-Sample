# World-Driver-Code-Snippets
Snippets of the code from my world driver project open for review

All 3rd party libraries used have been given credit in the 3rd party example code which should be use for contrast and comparison only with my existing code

### Code Included:
Sample-chunk_roads_manager.gd - A sample of the code, specifically the chunk manager

sample-retrieve_data.cpp - A sample of the code that retrieves the data from overpass API (NOTE: This is not used in the current final demo)

wd_vincety.cpp - the actual game code used to translate between cartesian and eliptical world coordinates and visa-versa
